# Debugging Process

## Template
  1. On what line (compared to the original code) will you put the debugger? Compare to the original code so that your line of code is not influenced by previous debugger statements.

  2. Why did you choose this line?

  3. What is your hypothesis for what the state of the program will be when you hit this debugger? For example, will it hit the debugger at all? What values will the variables have?
  4. When it hits the debugger, take a screenshot (ideally showing the updated values) and paste that here.
  5. Compare the results revealed by your debugger statement with your hypothesis. Were you correct? How does this influence your next step?


## Broken Test 1

### Debugger 1
  1. On what line (compared to the original code) will you put the debugger? Compare to the original code so that your line of code is not influenced by previous debugger statements.
  i will place a debugger on line
  <!-- i will place a debugger on line 13 because  -->
  2. Why did you choose this line?
  <!-- because the value of each part is NaN which tells me theres an issue with whats is being added the that value -->
  3. What is your hypothesis for what the state of the program will be when you hit this debugger? For example, will it hit the debugger at all? What values will the variables have?
